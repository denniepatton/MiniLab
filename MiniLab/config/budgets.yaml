# MiniLab Budget Configuration
# 
# This configuration defines dynamic budget allocation strategies.
# Agents can adapt these allocations based on project complexity,
# user preferences, and runtime conditions.
#
# Philosophy: Provide GUIDELINES, not rigid constraints.
# Agents should use judgment to optimize within the overall budget.

# Default workflow budget allocations (percentages of total session budget)
# These are STARTING POINTS - agents can reallocate dynamically
workflow_allocations:
  consultation: 0.05       # Quick: understand user needs
  literature_review: 0.20  # Background research
  planning_committee: 0.15 # Multi-agent deliberation
  execute_analysis: 0.35   # Core work - largest allocation
  writeup_results: 0.15    # Documentation and reports
  critical_review: 0.10    # Quality assurance

# Budget warning thresholds (percentage of total budget)
# Agents receive notifications at these levels
warning_thresholds:
  - 60   # Informational: entering second half
  - 80   # Warning: start prioritizing completion
  - 95   # Critical: wrap up immediately

# Complexity-based budget scaling
# Agents can request budget adjustments based on detected complexity
