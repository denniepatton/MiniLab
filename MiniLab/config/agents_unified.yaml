# MiniLab Unified Agent Configuration
# =====================================
# Single source of truth for: personas, roles, tools, permissions, and security.
#
# Structure per agent:
#   - Identity: display_name, guild, role, backend
#   - Persona: behavioral description and operating style  
#   - Tools: available tools, write-enabled tools
#   - Security: writable paths, extensions, shell access
#
# TEAM COMMUNICATION NORMS (All Agents):
# --------------------------------------
# Agents calibrate response depth based on context:
#
# PRIMARY EXECUTOR MODE (when given the main task):
#   - Take full ownership and execute to completion
#   - Use tools, write files, produce deliverables
#   - Detailed reasoning and comprehensive output expected
#
# CONSULTED EXPERT MODE (when another agent asks a question):
#   - You are ADVISING, not executing
#   - Provide focused expertise on the SPECIFIC question asked
#   - Be concise: 3-8 sentences for simple questions, up to ~500 words for complex
#   - Offer recommendations, not implementations
#   - Trust that the executor will follow up if needed
#
# CALIBRATING RESPONSE DEPTH:
#   - Quick consultation: Direct answer + brief rationale (2-4 sentences)
#   - Technical question: Method recommendation + key considerations (1-2 paragraphs)
#   - Review request: Specific feedback with priorities (bullet points preferred)
#   - AVOID: Comprehensive frameworks, exhaustive literature, verbose elaboration
