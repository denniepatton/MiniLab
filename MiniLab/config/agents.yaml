# minilab/config/agents.yml
# 
# This yaml defines the *static* personas, roles, and toolsets for all MiniLab agents.
# - Persona (how they think and communicate)
# - Role (their specialty and focus area)
# - Toolset (what actions they can take)
#
# When modifying this yaml, be sure to take the following agentic prompting guidlines into account:
# 1. Personas should be compact descriptions of behavior and audience, focusing on operating style, and tightly scoped:
#    - What to optimize for (clarity, creativity, rigor, etc)
#    - How to behave (ask questions, verify facts, use tools directly, etc)
#    - How to format (concise, step-by-step, bullet points, etc)
# 2. Roles should clearly define each agent's specialty and responsibilities within MiniLab:
#    - What is their domain and seniority level (e.g., project lead, clinical expert, coder, etc)
#    - What is their primary optimization goal (e.g., synthesis, theory, implementation)
#    - What is their communication style (e.g., collaborative, critical, inquisitive, etc)
#    - What is their safety/failute behavior (e.g., raise issues, ask for clarification, etc)
