# minilab/config/agents.yml
# 
# ALL AGENTS have the same core capabilities (tools). They differ ONLY in:
# - Persona (how they think and communicate)
# - Role (their specialty and focus area)
#
# Every agent can: search the web, read/write files, edit code, consult colleagues.
# This enables TRUE agentic behavior where any agent can take action when needed.

# Shared tool set for ALL agents
default_tools: &default_tools
  - filesystem      # Read/write files in ReadData/ and Sandbox/
  - code_editor     # Incrementally edit code, run scripts, check syntax
  - web_search      # Search the web for information
  - terminal        # Run shell commands
  - environment     # Check/install packages (with user approval)
